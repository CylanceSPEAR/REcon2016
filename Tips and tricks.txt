---- windbg.exe

Access Virtual-8086 mode memory (seg:ofs, where linear address = (seg << 4) + ofs):
db &0040:001E
dw &@ss:@sp

Access memory as 16-bit:
u #0207:0000

See "segment support" in windbg help index.


To debug RIPterm:

. Install an x86 edition of Windows that allows multiple concurrent
  users, such as Windows Server 2003 (32-bit)
. Create a second administrator user
. Open Control Panel > System (sysdm.cpl)
  . On the Remote tab, check "Enable Remote Desktop on this computer"
  . Click "Select Remote Users..." and add the second administrator user
    . Alternatively, add the second administrator user to the
      "Remote Desktop Users" group if it exists, or assign the
      "Allow log on through Terminal Services" right (secpol.msc:
      Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment)
. Run RIPTERM.EXE in the console session
. Connect to the system via Remote Desktop
  . Attach windbg.exe to the ntvdm.exe process running RIPterm

This is helpful because RIPterm runs in full-screen graphical mode, which is difficult to escape when ntvdm.exe breaks in the debugger.



---- DOSBox debugger

See "How to build and use DOSBox.txt" for information on building, configuring, and using DOSBox.
